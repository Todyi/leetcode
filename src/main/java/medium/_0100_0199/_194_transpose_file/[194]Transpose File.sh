#Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content. 
#
# You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is
# separated by the ' ' character. 
#
# Example: 
#
# If file.txt has the following content: 
#
# 
#name age
#alice 21
#ryan 30
# 
#
# Output the following: #
#name alice ryan
#age 21 30
